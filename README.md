GraphNet is a visual graph calculator that allows users to create, edit, and analyze graphs interactively. It includes various graph algorithms, although currently, only two have been implemented. The project aims to provide an intuitive and educational tool for understanding graph theory.

## Screenshots

**Step 1: Select the algorithm**  
Here you can choose the algorithm you will use, at the moment there are two options:
